# Simple-Packing
write a simple packing function that implements 'single ball model' and 'multiple-ball model' for packing only 5 - 10 macromolecules. So that we can simulate a subtomogram that contain one target macromolecule and some neighbor structures. And the simulation can be performed quickly in CPU.
