# Simple-Packing
a simple packing function that implements 'single ball model' and 'multiple-ball model' for packing only 5 - 10 macromolecules. So that we can simulate a subtomogram that contain one target macromolecule and some neighbor structures. And the simulation can be performed quickly in CPU.


# including thr following algorithm
###### 1. using single sphere to model one macromolecule, packing using gradient descent.

###### 2. using multiple spheres to model one macromolecule, packing using gradient descent.

###### 2. using single sphere to model one macromolecule, packing using MD.
